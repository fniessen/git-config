* svn diff zip revision to deploy

Make release package (get list of changed files via svn diff log and zip them):

svn-rev-patch:

#+begin_src shell
# For one release only.
svn diff -c 124 --summarize | cut -c 9- | xargs zip -9 patch.zip

# For a range of releases.
svn diff -r 123:124 --summarize | cut -c 9- | xargs zip -9 patch.zip
#+end_src

This will create a ZIP file with the changed file(s) -- in an intact directory
structure -- from revision ~123:HEAD~.

#+begin_note
~-c ARG~ = change made by revision ~ARG~ (like ~-r ARG-1:ARG~)
#+end_note

* Others

We also supply four bash shell aliases that make status checks of your working
copy easier, add them to your ~.bashrc~:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
alias svnl="svn log -r 1:HEAD -v"    # Show log messages
alias svnm="svn status -u -q"        # Show locally/repository changed items
alias svnn="svn status -q"           # Show locally changed items
alias svns="svn status -u -q -v"     # Show status of all items
#+END_SRC

To *compare all modified files* in your working copy with the HEAD revision in the
repository, use the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
alias svndiffall="echo svn status | grep '^M' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs svn diff -rHEAD"
#+END_SRC

* Incoming

Depending on what you want to know between your working copy and the latest svn
server repository, without updating your local working copy, here is what you
can do:

If you want to know what has been changed in svn server repository, run command:

#+begin_src shell
svn st -u
#+end_src

If you want to know if the same file has been modified both in your local
working copy and in svn server repository, run command:

#+begin_src shell
svn st -u | grep -i "^M \{7\}\*"
#+end_src

If you want to get list of files changed between a particular revision and HEAD,
run command:

#+begin_src shell
svn diff -r revisionNumber:HEAD --summarize
#+end_src

If you want to get a list of files changed between paticular revisions, run
command:

#+begin_src shell
svn diff -r revisionNumber:anotherRevisionNumber --summarize
#+end_src

If you want to know what content of a particular file has been changed in svn
server repository compared with your working copy, run command:

#+begin_src shell
svn diff -r BASE:HEAD ./pathToYour/file
#+end_src

If you want to know what contents of all the files have been changed in svn
server repository compared with your working copy, run command:

#+begin_src shell
svn diff -r BASE:HEAD .
#+end_src

* Overview

The following aliases are interesting for using SVN a bit like Git.

* Log

** One-line log format

#+begin_src shell
alias svnlog="svn log | perl -l40pe 's/^-+/\n/'"
#+end_src

** Show a single revision

#+begin_src shell
svn diff -c <revision>
#+end_src

** Show what changed

Output filenames of files changed in each commit:

#+begin_src shell
svn log -v
#+end_src

* Incoming changes

** Check for modifications

Show which files are modified in the repository (with an ~*~):

#+begin_src shell
alias svn-incoming='svn status -u | grep \*'
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell
svn log -r BASE:HEAD                    # Equivalent of `git log'
svn log --diff -r BASE:HEAD             # Equivalent of `git log -p'
#+end_src

** Preview incoming changes

See what has been changed (how it's different from my working copy):

#+begin_src shell
svn diff -r BASE:HEAD
#+end_src

* SVN conflict

Quand probl√®me avec psvn, s'en sortir en faisant :

#+begin_src shell
svn status (-q)
svn resolved (FILE)
svn status (-q)
#+end_src

* Checkout a specific older version of the source code

Update the revision (say we want to get r4732):

#+begin_src shell
svn update -r4732
#+end_src
